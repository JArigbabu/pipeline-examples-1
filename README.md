This repo contains example Jenkins Pipelines inside the jobs directory.

The related pipeline jobs in Jenkins can be generated by JobDSL

# Start

1 install the  JobDSL[https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugi] Plugin

2 Create and run a new Pipeline job which points to `Jenkinsfile-Seed.groovy`  (which does some pre-work such as gathering GHAPI libs in the Classpath)

3 jobs are generated in the pipeline-example folder 


if you try to run the Jenkinsfiles standalone, you have to fix the path to the yamlFile of some `jobs/Jenkinsfile-*` in this area to your belongings
```
agent {
    kubernetes {
        yamlFile 'yaml/podTemplate.yml'
    }
}
```
