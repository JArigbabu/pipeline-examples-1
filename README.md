This repo contains example Jenkins Pipelines inside the jobs directory.

The related pipeline jobs in Jenkins can be generated by JobDSL

# Start

1 install the  JobDSL[https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugi] Plugin

2 Create and run a new Pipeline job which points to `Jenkinsfile-Seed.groovy`  (which does some pre-work such as gathering GHAPI libs in the Classpath)

3 jobs are generated in the pipeline-example folder
